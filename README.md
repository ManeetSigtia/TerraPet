## Project Description
### The Problem
The app rewards users for achieving their weekly goals by growing a virtual pet, which improves as the user becomes healthier and more active.

### The Solution

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ``git clone https://github.com/ManeetSigtia/course-registration-system.git``

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ``cd course-registration-system``
  
3. Run the main script by executing the following command:

    ``python main.py``
 
4. You should now see a login window pop-up appear.

 
## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement
- An additional field can be added during Course Creation stage that segregates the courses into two, “Regular Courses” and “Holiday Camps”. Based on this, further operations can be done for each category.

- As of now, the users must choose from a fixed number of Course names. In the future, as the academy grows, they may have more names to offer. Thus a feature that allows them to add, delete and edit course names to the current list could be included.

- Along with generation of reports in the form of text files, PDF reports can be generated. These could be treated as certificates for students that indicate they have completed a course. Moreover, the application could provide the ability to connect to a printer and print reports as and when required by the user.
